# Forecast of metered energy consumption
Today, significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies, but owners make payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. So, we have chosen a Kaggle case competition focusing on building accurate models of metered building energy usage provided by ASHRAE, an institute that serves to advance the arts and sciences of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and their allied fields.
